The Restaurant App is a project I created to help streamline restaurant operations and improve the customer experience. It features several pages designed to make both ordering and menu management easier. The Appointments Page lets customers book reservations directly, while the Menu Screen displays a fully customizable menu where customers can browse and select dishes. The Course List Page organizes the menu into different meal courses, making it easier for customers to plan their order. For restaurant staff, I built the Add Dish and Add Menu pages, which allow for quick and easy updates to the menu by adding new dishes or creating entire menus. The Manage Menu Page gives administrators the ability to modify, delete, or rearrange menu items as needed. Overall, the app is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and efficient, helping both restaurant staff and customers have a smoother and more organized experience.
